			<p>Two planets glide down the southwestern sky this evening (September 12). Bright orange Mars is low in the south-southwest as night falls, with fainter Saturn to the right by about the width of your fist held at arm&#146;s length.</p>
			<h2>Different Categories of Planets</h2>
			<p>These worlds represent different categories of planets. Mars is small and rocky planet, like Earth, while Saturn is a big ball of gas.</p>
			<p>Many of the thousands of planets found in other star systems fall into discrete categories as well. There are <a class="p-link" target="top" href="images/super_earth.png">super-Earths</a>, <a class="p-link" target="top" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4AuLbuegLAI/U9T3_CfQp5I/AAAAAAAAGwA/ajJ_NbnzHl4/s1600/Post+-+August+2014+(3)+-+1.jpg">mini-Neptunes</a>, <a class="p-link" target="top" href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sites/www.cfa.harvard.edu/files/styles/width720/public/images/pr//2009-05.jpg?itok=dR0Z62wa">super-Neptunes</a>, super-Jupiters, and <a class="p-link" target="top" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/HD188753-hot-jupiter-1.jpg">hot-Jupiters</a>.</p>
			<p>Super-Earths are up to few times the mass of Earth. They&#146;re still balls of rock and metal, but they may be much denser than Earth.</p>
			<p>Neptune is the most-distant planet in the solar system, and consists of layers of rock, ice, and gas. Mini-Neptunes are smaller than neptune, but they have the same basic structure. super-Neptunes are also put together like our Neptune, but they&#146;re up to a few times more massive.</p>
			<p>Super-Jupiters are more massive than our Jupiter, the giant of our solar system. They probably have dense cores enveloped by deep layers of gas. They&#146;re about the same size as Jupiter, but up to several dozen times its mass.</p>
			<p>Hot Jupiters were some of the first planets ever discovered. One of the best-known hot Jupiters is 51 Pegasi b. was discovered in 1995. Such a world is similar to Jupiter, but much closer to its star. That can heat its outer atmosphere to thousands of degrees -- creating a category of planets unlike anything in our own solar system.
